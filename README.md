# Blue Yonder Dispatcher Enhancement Libraries

A collection of open-source libraries, utilities, and extensions designed to **enhance, extend, and streamline functionality when working with Blue Yonder Dispatcher**.

This repository provides reusable components intended to help customers, partners, and developers accelerate integrations, improve dispatcher workflows, and reduce custom implementation effort.

This repository aims to provide:

- Reusable libraries that complement Dispatcher capabilities
- Common integration and automation patterns
- Utilities to simplify Dispatcher-related development
- Reference implementations and best practices

These libraries are intended for technical users familiar with Blue Yonder Dispatcher,
including developers, solution architects, and implementation teams.

All libraries are provided **as-is** under the permissive **MIT License**.
